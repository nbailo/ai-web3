Current organisation structure in strategy-agent:
-flaskapp.py is main app
-datatypes.py is for data types
-fetchdata.py is for fetching data from the price-engine. I will add DB fetch later 
-dump.py is vibe code generated by cursor, which I have yet to understand 
-requirements.txt is for the python dependencies. there might be some unused libraries
